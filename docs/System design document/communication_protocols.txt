The embedded board has a couple of sensors connected to it. Each one of them has to communicate with the board through a given
communication protocol. They are as follows:
1. The temperature and humidity sensor uses I²C.
2. The VOC sensor uses I²C.
3. The CO2 sensor uses UART.

Communication between the Embedded board and the C# application will be based on a custom protocol which will be agreed on with 3 other
teams in the future. Communication will occur once every 15 minutes or at sudden changes of sensor readings.
